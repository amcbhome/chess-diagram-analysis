Develop a project using python/GitHub/Streamlit that requests a FEN from the user. Create an option for Masters or Lichess database. The Lichess option will have further selection of rating. The user will have an interactive experience of studying the next move from the various databases. Put the user input and database selection in the Streamlit sliding panel. I want an app.py and requirements.txt that I can deploy on my GitHub "chess-diagram-analysis".
